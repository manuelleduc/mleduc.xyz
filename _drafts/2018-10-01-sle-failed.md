# Introduction

> The hardest program I’ve ever written, once you strip out the whitespace, is 3,835 lines long. That handful of code took me almost a year to write. Granted, that doesn’t take into account the code that didn’t make it. The [commit history](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_style/commits/master) shows that I deleted 20,704 lines of code over that time. Every surviving line has about three fallen comrades

Reading this in the words of Bob Nystrom, successful game developer and programming language expert, in his article [The Hardest Program I've Ever Written](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/09/08/the-hardest-program-ive-ever-written/), was quite a painful paragraph to read.

How can, somebody frequently in front page of Hacker News ([stuffwithstuff.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=stuffwithstuff.com) / [craftinginterpreters.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=craftinginterpreters.com)) be struggling to implement a code formatting library.
