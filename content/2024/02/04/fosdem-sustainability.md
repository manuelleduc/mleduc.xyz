Sustainability is a topic I'm interested in, and I got the chance to attend [FOSDEM 2024](https://fosdem.org/2024/).
This seems like a great opportunity to do a quick summary of all the talks linked to sustainability in the Open Source world presented during the event!

By sustainability, I here mean the ecological sense of the term, in opposition to project growth as I saw it used that way in several abstracts.

Disclaimer: I was part of the audience for some of the talks listed below, but given the astronomic number of talks, I wasn't there for all of them.
Luckly, everything is recorded and available online. 

If time allows, I'll develop on the content of some of the talks, but that's for another time.
