I am currently a PhD in the [DiverSE](https://diverse-project.github.io/) team
with [Benoit Combemale](http://people.irisa.fr/Benoit.Combemale/) and [Olivier Barais](http://olivier.barais.fr/).

I am interested in all aspect of Software Language Engineering and Language Engineering.
My PhD is focused on the formal ans executable specifications of Domain-Specific Language
Families. More precisely, I aim at improving reuse and agility of Domain-Specific software languages
through modularity and variability of software languages formal specifications.
